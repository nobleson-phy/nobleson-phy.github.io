## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of fundamental physics, astrophysics, and high-precision measurement. As a member of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) and the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) consortium, I contribute to a global effort using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) as a galaxy-scale gravitational wave observatory.

Millisecond pulsars are nature's most stable celestial clocks. By meticulously measuring the arrival times of their radio pulses over years and decades, we can detect the subtle, correlated distortions in spacetime caused by passing gravitational waves in the nanohertz frequency band. My specific expertise lies in using noise models for pulsar timing and applying sophisticated Bayesian data analysis techniques to separate this faint gravitational wave signal from a complex background of astrophysical and instrumental noise.

Our work is opening a new observational window on the low-frequency gravitational wave universe. The primary target is the stochastic background generated by the cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries, which will illuminate the dynamics of galaxy mergers throughout cosmic history. Beyond this background, we search for individual continuous wave sources and explore the potential signatures of exotic phenomena from the early universe.

I am also interested in exploiting the unique role of neutron stars as extreme astrophysical laboratories for fundamental physics. By studying neutron star properties such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability, I aim to place constraints on the dense-matter equation of state and test alternative theories of gravity. This approach enables direct exploration of gravity in the strong-field regime and matter at supra-nuclear densities, advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws governing the universe. 

Keywords: Gravitational Waves, Pulsar Timing Arrays, Millisecond Pulsars, Supermassive Black Hole Binaries, Bayesian Inference, Time-Domain Astrophysics.
