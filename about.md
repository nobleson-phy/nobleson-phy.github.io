## About Me

I am a researcher working at the intersection of gravitational wave astronomy, pulsar timing, and neutron star physics. I completed my Ph.D. at the Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani in 2023 with a thesis on "Advanced Studies on Neutron Stars and Pulsars." I then held a postdoctoral position at Kumamoto University, Japan (2023--2025), contributing to key data releases of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) and international data combination efforts.

I hold two M.Sc. degrees from Osmania University -- one in Mathematics (2000) and one in Astronomy & Astrophysics (2018), where my thesis focused on short-period eclipsing Post Common Envelope Binaries. Prior to my research career, I worked as a graphic designer at Deloitte (2005--2016) and as a medical transcriptionist at Vasant Scribes (2000--2005).

## Research Overview

My research spans two main areas:

### Pulsar Timing Arrays & Gravitational Waves
As a member of the **Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA)** and the **International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)**, I contribute to the global effort of detecting nanohertz gravitational waves using millisecond pulsars as cosmic clocks. My work focuses on:
- Noise modelling and Bayesian data analysis for pulsar timing array datasets


I have contributed to both InPTA data releases (DR1 and DR2) which provided low-freqeuncy data for better estimation of chromatic processes.

### Neutron Stars & Modified Gravity
I study neutron star properties -- mass, radius, and tidal deformability -- as probes of fundamental physics. My work in this area includes:
- Testing f(R) modified gravity theories using neutron star observations
- Demonstrating that tidal deformability constrains the f(R) free parameter by an order of magnitude
- Unveiling a universal relationship between the f(R) parameter and neutron star maximum mass using Bayesian analysis

## Collaborations

## Publications
