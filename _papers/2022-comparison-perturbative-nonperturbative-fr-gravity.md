  In this work, we investigate the structure and properties of neutron stars in R^2 gravity using two approaches, viz: the perturbative and non-perturbative methods. For this purpose, we consider NS with several nucleonic, as well as strange EoS generated in the framework of relativistic mean field models. The strange particles in the core of NS are in the form of Lambda hyperons and quarks, in addition to the nucleons and leptons. In both the approaches, we obtain mass-radius relation for a wide range of values of the extra degree of freedom parameter a arising due to modification of gravity at large scales. The mass-radius relation of the chosen equation of states lies well within the observational limit in the case of GR. We identify the changes in the property of neutron star in the background of f(R) gravity, and compare the results in both the methods. We also identify the best suited method to study the modified gravity using the astrophysical observations.
